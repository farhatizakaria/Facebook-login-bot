# Facebook-login-bot
This is a bot for automatic login to your facebook account, but this bot is under-development

# Is it safe?
Yes, it's fully safe there's no hacking script or something made for steal your account it's just for doing that boring routien of logining in Facebook :smile:

# Warning
This script tested on Firefox, but you can change it to work on another brower, just change this 12nd line

```self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()```

and write your data in these lines

```
emailTest = None # Write here your email
pw = 0000 # Also your password
```

> But this script is under-dev, that's mean I am gonna make it awsome than now
