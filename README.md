This is a bot for automatic login to your facebook account, but this bot is under-development

# Is it safe?
Yes, it's fully safe there's no hacking script or something made for steal your account it's just for doing that boring routien of logining in Facebook :smile:

# Warning

## Make sure if the browser displayed
I add the this file ````/geckodriver/geckodriver.exe```` copy it and paste it in your windows path such as ````C:\```` and add the final path in variable environment settings and enjoy !

> But this script is under-dev, that's mean I am gonna make it awsome than now
